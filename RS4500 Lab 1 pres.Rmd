## Components of a Network

> - Node (Vertex or Point or Junction)
> - Edge (Connection or Flow or Relationship) 
> - Plot Area (Space or Graph)

## Strength and Weaknesses of Working with Networks

> - Networks are versatile but subjective
> - Questions of scale, limits, definitions
> - Nodes and Edges are ambiguous and arbitrary
> - Networks are impressive!

## What is a Node?

> - Any "Actor"
> - Individual
> - Organization
> - Place or Structure
> - Idea or Concept
> - OR a network!

## What is an Edge? {.build}

### Any type of relationship
